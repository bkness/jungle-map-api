# Jungle Map API

## Description

NBA Standings Application This NBA Standings Application is a demonstration of our proficiency in integrating APIs to deliver accurate and relevant information to users. The application provides NBA standings for a chosen season, enhanced with engaging visuals. The goal of Jungle Map was to bring statisitics to users in a easy to read format. No ad-blocks, or hard to read screens, just statistics that are easy to read for your favorite NBA teams. While utilizing and creating modals, event listeners, local storage, and css frameworks we were able to solidify our knowledge in javascript and CSS to make this application run smoothly but also look nice
